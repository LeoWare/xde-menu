xde-menu 0.8 - Stable release of xde-menu

This is a stable release of the xde-menu package that provides
XDG compliant menu generation for a wide range of light-weight
window managers as well as providing a pop-up and system-tray
GTK+ menu.  All of the functionality is working, including many
window-manager specific sub-menus and startup notification
completion.  This release fixes several issues with option
handling and now fully supports specifying the GTK+ theme and
icon theme used to generate or display menus.  Attached is an
autoconf tarball for building the package from source.  See TODO
and NEWS in the release for more information.
